# Middleman template for netlify

This template is a fork of the thoughtbot middleman-netlify boilerplate. I've converted most of the erb to haml because I like it better but I haven't made any structural changes. 

I've also added therubyracer and rb-inotify to the Gemfile, because they're needed in order to get middleman working on ubuntu 16.04... at least on my machine.
